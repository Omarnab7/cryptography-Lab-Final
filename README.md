# Caesar Cipher Utility Documentation

This Python script provides a simple Caesar Cipher **encryption** and **decryption** system, with added language detection using the `enchant` dictionary for English text.

---

## 🔐 What It Does

- Encrypts plain English text using the Caesar Cipher (shifts letters by `n` positions).
- Attempts to decrypt a Caesar Ciphered string by trying all possible shifts and selecting the most likely correct one based on dictionary matches.

---

## 🔧 Functions

### `encrypt_caesar_cipher(data: str, nkey: int = 2) -> str`

Encrypts an input string using a Caesar cipher shift.

#### Arguments:
- `data`: The string to encrypt (only alphabetic characters and spaces).
- `nkey`: Integer key used to shift each letter (default: 2).

#### Returns:
- Encrypted string.

#### Raises:
- `ValueError`: If input contains anything other than letters and spaces.

#### Example:
```python
encrypt_caesar_cipher("hello world", 3)  # Output: "khoor zruog"
```

---

### `decrypt_caesar_cipher(ct: str) -> tuple[list, str, int]`

Tries all 26 Caesar shifts to decrypt the ciphered text and selects the most likely English sentence.

#### Arguments:
- `ct`: Ciphered string to decrypt.

#### Returns:
- `permutes`: List of all 26 possible decryptions.
- `chosen_text`: Most likely English sentence.
- `chosen_index`: Caesar shift used to decrypt (negative value).

#### Example:
```python
decrypt_caesar_cipher("zxuu rd kwnjsl bmtq bj fyyfhp")
# Might return: (['...list of guesses...'], 'sup my friend when we attack', -5)
```

---

## 🧪 Example (`__main__` block)

```python
ct = encrypt_caesar_cipher("sup my friend when we attack", 5)
print(decrypt_caesar_cipher(ct))
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- `pyenchant`: Used for English dictionary checks during decryption.
  - Install via: `pip install pyenchant`

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Notes

- Input text must be alphabetic (plus spaces), lowercase is enforced.
- Decryption assumes valid English text and checks for at least 3 valid words.
- This is not a secure cryptographic method, just a toy example for educational use.
